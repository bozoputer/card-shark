<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Card Shark

Card shark has the following exciting features:
- Display card value and suit (e.g. ‚ÄúK of Hearts‚Äù) of each card
- Display how many cards are remaining in the deck
- Add and implement the following buttons:
  - Shuffle - randomize the order of the cards
  - Reset - reset the deck back to ‚Äúin order, separated by suit‚Äù with a standard 52-card set
  - Draw - remove the top card from the deck and display the card value and suit on the page
  - Face down - instead of displaying the values of the cards, display only ‚ÄúCard‚Äù and its position in the deck (e.g. Card 1, Card 2)
  - Face up - display the cards (in their current order) with their value and suit
